# YellowBox Deployment Instructions

## Overview
The YellowBox application has been successfully built and is ready for deployment to Firebase Hosting. All role permission changes have been implemented and tested.

## Changes Deployed
1. **Finance Role** - Enhanced access to Category Settings and Bike Settings
2. **Driver/Rider Role** - Comprehensive personal settings including language, timezone, location, and notification preferences
3. **Security** - API Keys and Sync Settings remain Admin-only

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Firebase Authentication
First, you need to authenticate with Firebase:

```bash
firebase login
```

This will open a browser window for you to log in with your Google account that has access to the yellowbox-8e0e6 project.

### 2. Deploy to Firebase Hosting
Once authenticated, deploy the application:

```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### 3. Deploy Firestore Rules (if needed)
To also deploy the Firestore security rules:

```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### 4. Full Deployment
To deploy everything (hosting + firestore rules):

```bash
firebase deploy
```

# Fleet Tracking System Requirements

## Introduction

The Fleet Tracking System provides real-time GPS monitoring and location management for delivery riders. It integrates with Google Maps API to display live rider locations, track movement patterns, monitor performance metrics, and provide district-based location detection for operational efficiency.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an Operations staff member, I want to view real-time locations of all active riders on a map, so that I can monitor fleet distribution and coordinate deliveries effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the bike tracker page THEN the system SHALL display a Google Maps interface with all active rider locations
2. WHEN I view the map THEN the system SHALL show custom markers for each rider with their current status
3. WHEN I click on a rider marker THEN the system SHALL display rider details including name, phone, battery level, and speed
4. WHEN rider locations update THEN the system SHALL refresh markers in real-time without page reload

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an Operations staff member, I want to track rider movement history and patterns, so that I can analyze performance and optimize delivery routes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a rider THEN the system SHALL display their movement history for the selected time period
2. WHEN I view movement history THEN the system SHALL show route paths on the map with timestamps
3. WHEN I analyze rider patterns THEN the system SHALL provide distance traveled and time spent in different districts
4. WHEN I export tracking data THEN the system SHALL generate reports with location history and performance metrics

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an Operations staff member, I want to monitor rider performance metrics like speed and battery levels, so that I can ensure operational efficiency and rider safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view rider details THEN the system SHALL display current speed, battery level, and last update time
2. WHEN a rider's battery is low THEN the system SHALL highlight the marker with a warning indicator
3. WHEN a rider exceeds speed limits THEN the system SHALL alert operations staff with notifications
4. WHEN I monitor performance THEN the system SHALL track average speed, idle time, and active hours

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an Operations staff member, I want to detect which district each rider is currently in, so that I can assign deliveries based on location and manage district coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view rider locations THEN the system SHALL display the current district for each rider
2. WHEN riders move between districts THEN the system SHALL update their district assignment automatically
3. WHEN I filter by district THEN the system SHALL show only riders in the selected district
4. WHEN I analyze coverage THEN the system SHALL provide district-wise rider distribution reports

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an Admin, I want to configure tracking settings and manage GPS devices, so that I can maintain system accuracy and control tracking parameters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I configure tracking THEN the system SHALL allow setting update intervals and tracking parameters
2. WHEN I manage devices THEN the system SHALL provide GPS device registration and assignment to riders
3. WHEN I set geofences THEN the system SHALL allow defining district boundaries and alert zones
4. WHEN I monitor system health THEN the system SHALL provide tracking accuracy metrics and device status

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Rider, I want to share my location for tracking purposes, so that operations can monitor my status and coordinate deliveries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enable location sharing THEN the system SHALL track my GPS coordinates with my consent
2. WHEN I update my status THEN the system SHALL reflect changes in the operations dashboard
3. WHEN I go offline THEN the system SHALL show my last known location and offline status
4. WHEN I have privacy concerns THEN the system SHALL allow me to control location sharing settings

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an Operations staff member, I want to receive alerts for unusual rider behavior or emergencies, so that I can respond quickly to safety concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a rider stops moving for extended periods THEN the system SHALL send idle time alerts
2. WHEN a rider deviates significantly from expected routes THEN the system SHALL trigger route deviation alerts
3. WHEN a rider activates emergency mode THEN the system SHALL immediately alert operations with location details
4. WHEN system detects anomalies THEN the system SHALL log incidents and notify appropriate personnel

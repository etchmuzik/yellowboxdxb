3. WHEN data is saved THEN Firestore SHALL store it with proper security rules
4. WHEN files are uploaded THEN Firebase Storage SHALL handle them securely
5. WHEN security rules are applied THEN they SHALL enforce role-based access control
6. WHEN the database is queried THEN proper indexes SHALL be in place for performance
7. WHEN Firebase functions are needed THEN they SHALL be deployed and accessible

### Requirement 4: Role-Based Access Control

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want role-based access control so that users only see features appropriate to their role.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an Admin logs in THEN they SHALL have access to all system features

3. WHEN a Finance user logs in THEN they SHALL have access to expense and financial features
4. WHEN a Rider logs in THEN they SHALL only have access to their personal data and documents
5. WHEN a user tries to access unauthorized features THEN the system SHALL prevent access
6. WHEN user roles are assigned THEN they SHALL be enforced both client-side and server-side
7. WHEN role permissions change THEN the system SHALL update access immediately

### Requirement 5: Production Environment Setup

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want a production-ready deployment so that the application runs reliably for end users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN it SHALL use production Firebase configuration
2. WHEN users access the application THEN it SHALL be served over HTTPS
3. WHEN the application builds THEN it SHALL be optimized for production
4. WHEN errors occur in production THEN they SHALL be logged and monitored
5. WHEN the application scales THEN it SHALL handle increased load appropriately
6. WHEN backups are needed THEN Firebase data SHALL be backed up regularly
7. WHEN monitoring is required THEN application health SHALL be tracked

### Requirement 6: Data Migration and Seeding

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want initial data setup so that the application has necessary reference data and test accounts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is first deployed THEN initial admin accounts SHALL be created
2. WHEN reference data is needed THEN lookup tables SHALL be populated
3. WHEN testing is required THEN sample data SHALL be available
4. WHEN user roles are configured THEN default permissions SHALL be set
5. WHEN the system starts THEN all required collections SHALL exist in Firestore
6. WHEN data validation is needed THEN proper constraints SHALL be enforced
7. WHEN data integrity is required THEN referential integrity SHALL be maintained

### Requirement 7: Security Hardening

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want comprehensive security measures so that the application protects sensitive data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users authenticate THEN passwords SHALL meet security requirements
2. WHEN data is transmitted THEN it SHALL be encrypted in transit
3. WHEN data is stored THEN sensitive information SHALL be properly protected
4. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL be authenticated and authorized
5. WHEN file uploads occur THEN they SHALL be validated and scanned
6. WHEN security events happen THEN they SHALL be logged for audit
7. WHEN vulnerabilities are discovered THEN they SHALL be addressed promptly

### Requirement 8: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast application performance so that I can work efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

# Domain Setup Checklist

## Immediate Action Required

### ⚠️ Step 1: Remove DNS Record
**You need to do this now to proceed:**

1. Log into your DNS provider (where you manage yellowboxdxb.com)
2. Find the DNS management section
3. Delete this record:
   ```
   Type: A
   Name: yellowboxdxb.com (or @)
   Value: 185.158.133.1
   ```

### ✅ Step 2: Verify Removal
After removing the record, wait 5-10 minutes, then check:
```bash
nslookup yellowboxdxb.com
```
The A record should no longer point to 185.158.133.1

### ✅ Step 3: Complete Firebase Setup
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/yellowbox-8e0e6/hosting/main)
2. Click "Add custom domain"
3. Enter `yellowboxdxb.com`
4. Follow the verification steps

### ✅ Step 4: Add New DNS Records
Firebase will provide new DNS records to add. They'll look like:
```
Type: A
Name: yellowboxdxb.com
Value: [Firebase will provide IP addresses]
```

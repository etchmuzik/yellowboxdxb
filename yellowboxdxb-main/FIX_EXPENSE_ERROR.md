# Fix "Failed to assign cost" Error

## âœ… What We've Done

1. **Updated Firestore Security Rules**
   - Deployed comprehensive rules from yellowboxdxb project
   - Added proper permission checks for expense creation
   - Rules now properly validate user roles

2. **Created User Role Management Tool**
   - `check-user-roles.html` - Use this to verify and update user roles

## ðŸ”§ Steps to Fix the Error

### 1. Check Your User Role
Open `check-user-roles.html` in a browser while running the app locally, or deploy it temporarily:
```bash
# Option 1: Open locally
open check-user-roles.html

# Option 2: Deploy temporarily (remove after fixing)
cp check-user-roles.html dist/
firebase deploy --only hosting
# Then visit: https://yellowbox-8e0e6.web.app/check-user-roles.html
```

### 2. Verify/Update User Roles
The expense assignment requires one of these roles:
- **Admin** - Full access
- **Finance** - Can manage expenses and budgets

If your user doesn't have the correct role:
1. Use the tool to update your role to Admin or Finance
2. Or have an Admin user update your role

### 3. Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "Permission Denied"
**Solution**: User needs Admin or Finance role

#### Issue: "User document not found"
**Solution**: The tool will create a user document automatically

#### Issue: "Session expired"
**Solution**: Log out and log back in
